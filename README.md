# CS-230

The Gaming Room is a team that wanted an application "Draw it or Lose it" to be playable cross platform and communicate over different OS. They wanted software that allowed them to make their game communicate over Mac, Windows, Linux, and mobile devices.
 
I believe that my strong suit in this documentation was giving strong pros and cons to each category, considering each of the 4 OS have both very different pros and cons.

I feel that going through the document while developing code gave me a sense of organization and alertness. I was able to clearly see what was needed from me, and it taught me way more about each OS than I ever knew before.

If I could revise a part of my documentation, I would revise the evaluation portion of the document. I would go into further research to give a better illustrated answer, rather than what I had given.

To communicate what the user wants, and implement it into your design can be tricky, considering many times some miscommunication is common. I simply read carefully, and followed directions. Considering the user's needs will determine the importance of your work upon their eyes.

My approach to designing software was very careful. I was a bit overwhelmed when I first started designing, and it seemed like I was rather lost. So I changed up my approach and I took everything one step at a time, and made sure to double check everything to ensure everything ran smoothly. So from now on, a careful approach is how I will approach life's problems.
